## Description: 
This is a simple desktop based unity 2-D game which involves Covid as it’s main theme. 
To test the game, there are two options:

From Source\Assets\Scenes,open the start menu scene in unity.

## Instructions:
A simple game, to succeed in this game the Nurse has to finish collecting the masks and has to bring the patient to his designated room.
This is a Covid - 19 related game so the catch is that while the Nurse is doing his/her task collecting masks and directing patients to his room, the nurse also needs to avoid the Covid viruses scattered in the hospital. In addition to all the tasks the nurse is performing, he/she must be cautious and avoid getting sick by all the virus around him/her. If the nurse got contact with the Covid virus health decreases. The nurse has three lives to complete the game and each encounter with the virus will cost him/her a life. There are a few bonus moves that will help you get your life back, which includes collecting sanitizer bottles, washing hands frequently and a few more. Follow the instructions in the game to get the Nurse discover hidden wards.
To start the game simply use your mouse and select START GAME if you are ready, if for some reason you would like to exit the game, select QUIT and it will take you out of the application. In order to actually begin the game, enter your name, but it should not exceed its 9 alphabet limit. You will not be able to begin unless you complete this crucial step of the game.
Lastly, make sure you read the instructions that will help you better understand the purpose of the game, and once ready simply hit the GOTCHA button. You have the option to either use your arrow keys to navigate or WASD keys to change the direction you wish the Nurse to go in. 

Once the nurse's health reached zero, there would be a quiz.The quiz consisted of three questions related to Covid - 19. To be able to go back to the game, it needs at least two correct answers. If there’s less than two correct answers then it’s GAME OVER. There will be only 3 chances for the nurse to succeed.
